## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS


### What I learned

This card project thought me how to install tailwind using the CLI, font-family customization and usage of tailwind utility classes. I look forward to improve my knowledge of tailwind css and becoming a better developer.



### Continued development

I will continue to go deeper into responsive design and uping my css design skills. To become one of the best developers in the world.
